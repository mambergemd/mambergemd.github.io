## Services

### Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy:
Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is a collaborative, experiential, and potentially transformative process that aims both to reduce suffering and to open the way to lasting change. My approach involves listening with attuned, non-judgmental curiosity as we work towards expanding insight into your inner life. This is achieved in part by our attending to interpersonal relationships - including the therapeutic relationship as it evolves over time - as well as to patterns and behaviors that promote or interfere with living in alignment with your desire and sense of self. Psychiatric symptoms are commonly multi-determined and my approach integrates an exploration of potentially contributory medical, generational, racial, and cultural factors. For more information about psychoanalytic psychotherapy, I invite you to review Dr. Jonathan Shedler’s publications [That Was Then, This is Now: Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy for the Rest of Us](https://jonathanshedler.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Shedler-2022-that-Was-Then-This-Is-Now-Psychoanalytic-Psychotherapy-For-The-Rest-Of-Us-1.pdf) and [The Efficacy of Psychodynamic Psychotherapy](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-65-2-98.pdf).

### Psychiatric Medication:
Psychiatric medication can be a life-altering tool, reducing suffering and expanding one’s ability to find fulfillment within themselves and their life circumstances. If we determine that medication is helpful or essential for you, I prefer to combine medication treatment with psychotherapy, either with me or in collaboration with your therapist. I am experienced in managing complicated medication regimens and guiding individuals interested in de-prescribing psychiatric medications when appropriate.
