## About

I am a board-certified psychiatrist and psychotherapist in private practice in Baltimore, MD. I received my medical degree from the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University and completed my residency training with the Georgetown University Hospital Department of Psychiatry. Previously, I worked as an attending psychiatrist with the Retreat at Sheppard Pratt, a residential treatment program which specializes in a psychodynamic and multidisciplinary approach to complex psychiatric illness. I have received advanced training in psychoanalytic psychotherapy from the Washington Baltimore Center for Psychoanalysis, where I am currently a candidate for psychoanalytic training. Outside of my clinical work, I am involved in teaching and supervising resident psychiatrists through Georgetown University and the University of Maryland.
