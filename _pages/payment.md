## Payment

Please reach out directly to inquire about fees. I am out-of-network with insurance companies. I accept payment directly via Zelle or check and provide an itemized receipt known as a superbill which you can submit to your insurer for reimbursement, the amount and terms of which will be determined by your insurance policy.

To learn more about your benefits, consider asking your insurer the following:
1. Do I have out-of-network mental health benefits?
2. How much of my session fees can I expect to be reimbursed? For medication management? For therapy with a psychiatrist?
3. Do I have a deductible, and if so, how much?
4. How many sessions can I expect to be reimbursed per year?

*A good-faith estimate of service costs is available upon request.*
